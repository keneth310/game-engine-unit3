# Space Escape + Apple Hunt: Space Shooter and Pok√©mon-style RPG:

This project showcases two unique games built using a custom game engine developed from scratch with Frenderer, a modular renderer powered by WGPU. By designing and implementing the underlying engine, we implemented key such as: 4-directional movement, a scrolling camera and world boundaries, simple collisions, and simple room loading, and collectible items around the game world. Both games utilize these features in a distinct ways to produce a unique experience.

## Technical Highlights
This project was a great learning experience, and helped us grow our proficiency in Rust programming, game development, and core software engineering principles. Here are some of our highlights:
1. Designed and implemented memory-efficient sprite management and rendering pipelines.
2. Engineered reusable game systems for collision, camera scrolling, and room transitions.
3. Utilized the Cargo build system for streamlined development and dependency management.
4. Optimized performance to ensure smooth gameplay across diverse hardware.
5. Created detailed and rich sprite-work leveraging Tiled and open-source art.

## How to Play

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. Install Rust if needed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Use the following commands in your terminal to launch the games:
  Type "cargo run --bin engine-simple-game" to run the Pokemon-sttyle RPG.
  To play the space shooter, type "cargo run --bin simple-game-2".
